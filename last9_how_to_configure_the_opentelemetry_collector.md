**How to configure the OpenTelemetry Collector**

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you get started with the OpenTelemetry collector.

1. Installation

Download the latest release of OpenTelemetry collector from the official GitHub repository and extract it to your desired location.

2. Configuration

Locate the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file in the extracted folder and open it with a text editor to configure the collector according to your needs. 

3. Create a Configuration File

Create a file named `config.yaml` and include the desired configuration for your OpenTelemetry collector. The configuration file allows you to define different receivers, processors and exporters. Below is an example configuration that receives data from OpenTelemetry SDK and exports it to Jaeger.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
  jaeger:
    protocols:
      thrift_http:

exporters:
  jaeger:
    endpoint: http://jaeger:14268/api/traces

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 1s

extensions:
  health_check:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [jaeger]
```

4. Create a Docker Compose File

Create a file named `docker-compose.yaml` and include the following content.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml
    ports:
      - 4317:4317
```

5. Start the OpenTelemetry Collector

Start the collector using Docker Compose. Run the following command.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the collector container in detached mode. Ensure your `config.yaml` file is properly configured based on your requirements.

In the example above, the OpenTelemetry collector is exposed on port 4317, corresponding to the default gRPC port. To use a different port, modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

6. Verify the Collector

Check the logs generated by the collector to ensure there are no errors. Verify that your chosen receiver(s) and exporter(s) function accordingly.

**How to deploy the OpenTelemetry Collector** 

You can deploy the OTel collector in three major ways.

1. Standalone Deployment

In this case, the collector is deployed as a separate process that can be run on any host or in a containerized environment such as Docker or Kubernetes, allowing you have dedicated resources for the collector. This approach enables its independent management, for easier updating and scaling. 

For standalone deployment of the collector, use the Docker image or binary distribution available from the official OpenTelemetry website. Configure the collector using a YAML configuration file and specify the desired receivers, exporters, processors, and extensions. Configure your standalone deployment with this command.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml
    ports:
      - 4317:4317
```

Start the standalone collector container with this command.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Sidecar Deployment

In a sidecar deployment, the collector is deployed alongside your application as a separate container or process. This method enables you to encapsulate the telemetry collection logic within the collector, reducing the complexity of your application code. It also provides isolation between telemetry collection and the application, making it easier to add or remove instrumentation without modifying the application itself. Configure the sidecar deployment using this code.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  my-app:
    image: my-app-image:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
  otel-collector:
    image: otel/opentelemetry-collector
    volumes:
      - ./config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml
    depends_on:
      - my-app
```

To deploy the sidecar OpenTelemetry collector, run this command.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Make sure to have your `config.yaml` file properly configured and adjust the paths, image names, and ports based on your specific setup.

3. Agent Deployment

Here, the collector is embedded within an existing monitoring agent or agent framework. The agent leverages existing infrastructure and monitoring tools to collect and export telemetry data. This approach helps consolidate data collection and reduces the complexity of managing separate components for monitoring and telemetry.

In agent deployments, you typically configure the collector by extending the agent's configuration file or using specific configuration properties provided by the agent framework. Here is an agent configuration file with the collector embedded.

```yaml
agent:
  collectors:
    telemetry:
      otel:
        config:
          receivers:
            otlp:
              protocols:
                grpc:
          exporters:
            jaeger:
              endpoint: http://jaeger:14268/api/traces
          processors:
            batch:
              timeout: 1s
```

Here is an application code for agent deployment with embedded OpenTelemetry collector.

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# Initialize the agent with embedded OpenTelemetry Collector
agent_config = {
    # Specify the agent configuration
    "config": "<path-to-agent-config-file>"
}

agent.init_agent(agent_config)

# Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK
provider = TracerProvider()
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Configure the OTLP exporter
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:4317")
span_processor = BatchSpanProcessor(exporter)
provider.add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Your application code here
```

**What is Context Propagation in Open Telemetry?**

Context propagation is a distributed tracing feature that involves propagating information alongside each request in a microservices architecture to monitor services’ interactions as the request progresses. To propagate context, an object (usually an identifier such as a trace or span ID, or any other relevant value set) is attached to a request automatically (via instrumentation libraries) or—though not recommended—manually (through the context API). 

Here's an example of automatic context propagation with Python.

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

# Retrieve the current span from the context
current_span = trace.get_current_span()

# Set attributes on the current span
current_span.set_attribute("attribute_key", "attribute_value")

# Retrieve the value of an attribute from the current span
attribute_value = current_span.get_attribute("attribute_key")
```
